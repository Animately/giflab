# Results Directory Migration Summary

**Date:** 2025-08-22  
**Migration Type:** Complete consolidation to unified structure

## What Was Done ✅

### 1. Code Updates
- **Fixed `GifLabRunner` default path**: `results/experiments` → `results/runs`
- **Updated error messages**: All references now point to `results/runs/latest/`
- **Fixed CLI examples**: `view_failures_cmd.py` now uses correct paths
- **Updated documentation**: All remaining `results/experiments` references changed

### 2. Data Migration  
- **Cache database moved**: `results/experiments/pipeline_results_cache.db` → `results/runs/pipeline_results_cache.db`
- **Historical data archived**: `results/experiments/` → `results/archive/experiments/`
- **Preserved all 171 historical experiment runs** (116MB of data)
- **Latest symlinks maintained**: Existing functionality preserved

### 3. Directory Structure
**Before:**
```
results/
├── experiments/  # 171 runs, 116MB (legacy experimental pipeline)
├── runs/         # 4 runs, 4.1MB (new unified pipeline)
└── samples/
```

**After:**
```
results/
├── runs/                    # Unified pipeline output (cache moved here)
├── archive/experiments/     # Historical data preserved (171 runs, 116MB)
├── samples/                 # Test GIF samples
└── cache/                   # Additional cache files
```

## Benefits Achieved 🎯

### 1. **Consistency Resolved**
- ❌ **Before**: CLI saved to `results/runs/` but code defaulted to `results/experiments/`
- ✅ **After**: All components use unified `results/runs/` directory

### 2. **Clear Structure**
- ❌ **Before**: Confusing dual directory system with unclear purposes
- ✅ **After**: Single active directory + archived historical data

### 3. **Data Preservation**
- ✅ All 171 historical experiment runs preserved in `results/archive/experiments/`
- ✅ Cache database migrated to maintain performance benefits
- ✅ All symlinks and latest references updated

### 4. **Functionality Maintained**
- ✅ `giflab run --list-presets` works perfectly
- ✅ `giflab run --preset quick-test --estimate-time` works perfectly  
- ✅ `giflab view-failures results/runs/latest/` uses correct paths
- ✅ All documentation references updated

## Impact Assessment 📊

### Storage
- **Active runs**: 4.5MB in `results/runs/` (+ cache database)
- **Archived data**: 116MB in `results/archive/experiments/` (read-only)
- **Total space**: Same as before, but better organized

### Functionality  
- **Zero breaking changes**: All existing workflows continue to work
- **Improved clarity**: Single source of truth for active results
- **Historical access**: Old data easily accessible in archive

### Performance
- **Cache preserved**: All historical cache entries maintained
- **No performance loss**: Cache database successfully migrated

## Validation Results ✅

All tests passed:
- ✅ `poetry run python -m giflab run --list-presets` - 14 presets displayed
- ✅ `poetry run python -m giflab run --preset quick-test --estimate-time` - Time estimation works  
- ✅ Directory structure is clean and organized
- ✅ All code references point to correct paths
- ✅ Historical data preserved and accessible

## Next Steps 📋

1. **Monitor**: Watch for any issues with new runs saving to `results/runs/`
2. **Cleanup**: After validation period, can optionally compress archived data
3. **Documentation**: Users can reference `results/README.md` for current structure

## Rollback Plan 🔄

If needed, migration can be reversed:
```bash
# Move archive back (if needed)
mv results/archive/experiments results/experiments

# Move cache back  
mv results/runs/pipeline_results_cache.db results/experiments/

# Revert code changes (git reset)
```

---

**Result: Clean, unified results structure that maintains all historical data while providing consistent behavior across all components.** ✅
