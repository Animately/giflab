```

## üìÅ Data Sources

All scripts are configured to work with the unified results directory:
- **Main data**: `results/runs/frame-comparison/latest/enhanced_streaming_results.csv`
- **Sample GIFs**: `results/samples/synthetic/`

## üîç Key Analyses Available

### Enhanced Metrics System (11-metric vs 4-metric)
- Comprehensive quality assessment using 11 dimensions
- Research-based weighting schemes
- More accurate quality predictions

### Efficiency Scoring
- `efficiency = compression_ratio √ó composite_quality`
- Balances compression and quality retention
- Clear performance tiers (Poor/Fair/Good/Excellent/Outstanding)

### Frame Reduction Algorithm Comparison
- 5 algorithms: gifsicle, imagemagick, animately, ffmpeg, none
- Counter-intuitive findings about frame reduction effectiveness
- Content-type specific recommendations

### Content Type Analysis
- 14 different GIF content types analyzed
- Performance varies dramatically by content (17x efficiency difference)
- Motion content compresses exceptionally well (up to 60x)
