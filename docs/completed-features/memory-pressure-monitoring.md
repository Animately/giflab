**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED  
**Completion Date:** 2025-01-11  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Owner:** @lachlants  
**Related Issue:** Phase 3.1 of Critical Code Review Issues Resolution  

## Overview

Comprehensive memory pressure monitoring infrastructure implementation that provides automatic memory tracking, pressure detection, and cache eviction policies to prevent system memory exhaustion. This critical safety feature enables safe activation of performance caching while maintaining system stability.

## Problem Statement

Prior to this implementation, GifLab lacked memory safety mechanisms for its caching systems. The risk of memory exhaustion could lead to:
- System crashes due to uncontrolled memory usage
- Performance degradation from excessive swapping
- Inability to safely enable performance optimizations
- No visibility into memory pressure conditions

## Solution Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. **SystemMemoryMonitor** (`memory_monitor.py`)
- **Cross-platform memory tracking** using psutil with robust fallbacks
- **Real-time pressure detection** with 4-tier classification system
- **Background monitoring** with configurable update intervals
- **Thread-safe implementation** with RLock-based synchronization

#### 2. **MemoryPressureManager** (`memory_monitor.py`)  
- **Automatic cache eviction** with priority-based policies
- **Configurable eviction policies** (Conservative/Aggressive)
- **Hysteresis prevention** to avoid eviction thrashing
- **Callback-based integration** with existing cache systems

#### 3. **CacheMemoryTracker** (`memory_monitor.py`)
- **Thread-safe memory aggregation** across all cache types
- **Real-time usage reporting** for frame, resize, and validation caches
- **Memory accounting** with MB-precision tracking

#### 4. **Memory Integration Layer** (`memory_integration.py`)
- **Seamless monitoring integration** with existing systems
- **Alert system integration** via AlertManager
- **Metrics system integration** for comprehensive reporting
- **Cache instrumentation** for automatic memory tracking

## Technical Implementation

### Memory Pressure Thresholds

```python
"thresholds": {
    "warning": 0.70,    # 70% system memory - first alert
    "critical": 0.80,   # 80% system memory - aggressive monitoring  
    "emergency": 0.95,  # 95% system memory - immediate eviction
}
```

### Eviction Policy

```python
"eviction_targets": {
    "warning": 0.15,    # Free 15% of process memory
    "critical": 0.30,   # Free 30% of process memory
    "emergency": 0.50,  # Free 50% of process memory
}
```

### Pressure Detection Algorithm

1. **Monitor system and process memory** every 5 seconds
2. **Calculate pressure level** based on system memory percentage
3. **Apply hysteresis** to prevent oscillation between states
4. **Trigger eviction** when thresholds exceeded with cooldown periods
5. **Execute priority-based eviction**: validation â†’ resize â†’ frame cache

### Configuration Integration

Added comprehensive memory pressure configuration to `config.py`:

```python
MONITORING = {
    "memory_pressure": {
        "enabled": True,
        "update_interval": 5.0,
        "auto_eviction": True,
        "eviction_policy": "conservative",
        "thresholds": {
            "warning": 0.70,
            "critical": 0.80, 
            "emergency": 0.95
        },
        "eviction_targets": {
            "warning": 0.15,
            "critical": 0.30,
            "emergency": 0.50
        },
        "hysteresis": {
            "enable_delta": 0.05,
            "eviction_cooldown": 30.0
        },
        "respect_cache_limits": True,
        "fallback_when_unavailable": True
    }
}
```
