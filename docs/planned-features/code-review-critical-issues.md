**Default Limits Adjustment:**
```python
FRAME_CACHE = {
    "memory_limit_mb": 200,  # Reduced from 500
    "resize_cache_memory_mb": 100,  # Reduced from 200
    "validation_memory_mb": 50,  # Reduced from 100
}
```

#### Subtask 3.2: Implement Cache Effectiveness Metrics 🟡 MINOR

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
1. **Circular Dependencies**: Could cause import failures in production
2. **Memory Leaks**: Caching without bounds could exhaust system memory
3. **Missing Dependencies**: Prevents any testing or deployment

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Feature Flags**: Disable experimental features by default
2. **Conservative Defaults**: Start with minimal cache sizes
3. **Monitoring**: Track all metrics to detect issues early
4. **Rollback Plan**: Maintain ability to disable all optimizations

---

## Technical Debt Items

### Immediate (P0)
- Missing `rich` dependency
- Duplicate function definitions
- Type annotation errors

### Sprint (P1)
- Circular import patterns
- Missing error handling
- Removed CLI commands

### Quarter (P2)
- Over-engineered configuration
- Premature optimization
- Complex caching architecture

### Backlog (P3)
- Missing documentation
- Test coverage gaps
- Performance baselines

---

## Success Metrics
- **Build Success Rate**: 100% (currently 0%)
- **Type Check Pass Rate**: 100% (currently failing with 24 errors)
- **Test Pass Rate**: >95% (currently unable to run)
- **Memory Usage**: <500MB under normal load
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >40% when enabled
- **Documentation Coverage**: 100% of public APIs

---

## Notes & Decisions

### Architectural Decisions
1. **Caching as Optional Feature**: Due to complexity and unproven benefits, caching should be opt-in
2. **Monitoring Disabled by Default**: Reduce overhead until performance impact measured
3. **Conservative Memory Limits**: Start low and increase based on real-world usage

### Lessons Learned
1. **Feature Branch Integration**: Need better testing before merging multiple features
2. **Dependency Management**: All new dependencies must be added to pyproject.toml immediately
3. **Type Safety**: Run mypy in CI to catch type errors early
4. **Documentation First**: Document design before implementation

### Follow-up Actions
1. Set up pre-commit hooks for type checking
2. Add dependency audit to CI pipeline
3. Create performance regression test suite
4. Establish code review checklist
