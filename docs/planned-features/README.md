# Planned Features Documentation System

This directory contains scope documents for planned features in GifLab. These documents follow a standardized format that enables Claude Code to easily consume, understand, and update implementation progress.

## üö® CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: Scope Document Updates Are Mandatory

**WHEN WORKING WITH ANY SCOPE DOCUMENT, UPDATING PROGRESS IS NON-NEGOTIABLE.**

### Absolute Requirements:
- **MUST** update document status after every completed subtask
- **MUST** update phase progress percentages in real-time  
- **MUST** change phase status icons when phases complete
- **MUST** update "Current Focus" descriptions as work progresses
- **FAILURE TO UPDATE** renders the document system worthless

### For Claude Code:
You are **REQUIRED** to update scope documents as an integral part of every task. Never complete work without updating the corresponding scope document. This is not optional - it's a core responsibility.

### For Human Contributors:
Treating scope document updates as "nice to have" breaks the entire system. Progress tracking is as important as the code changes themselves.

## Document Structure

### Required Frontmatter
Every scope document must begin with YAML frontmatter containing these required keys with their allowed values:

```yaml
---
name: Feature Name
priority: low|medium|high  # Priority level for implementation
size: tiny|small|medium|large  # Estimated complexity/effort
status: planning|ready|in-progress|testing|complete  # Current state
owner: @username  # GitHub username of responsible person
issue: GitHub issue number or "N/A"  # Associated issue tracking
---
```

#### Example Frontmatter
```yaml
---
name: Modular Experiment Presets
priority: high
size: medium
status: in-progress
owner: @lachlants
issue: "#245"
---
```

### Phase-Based Organization

All scope documents must be organized into clearly defined phases with trackable completion status:

#### Phase Tracking Format
```markdown
### Phase N: Phase Name ‚è≥ PLANNED
**Progress:** X% Complete
**Current Focus:** Brief description of current work

#### Subtask N.1: Subtask Name ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Pending task
- [x] Another completed task

#### Subtask N.2: Another Subtask Name ‚è≥ PLANNED
- [ ] Pending task
- [ ] Another pending task
```

#### Subtask Numbering Convention
- Use hierarchical numbering: `Phase.Subtask` (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, etc.)
- Phase numbers correspond to the main phase number
- Subtask numbers increment sequentially within each phase
- This enables precise referencing and progress tracking

### Status Legend

| Icon | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| ‚è≥ | PLANNED | Not yet started |
| üîÑ | IN PROGRESS | Currently being worked on |
| ‚úÖ | COMPLETE | Finished successfully |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è | BLOCKED | Cannot proceed due to dependency |
| ‚ùå | CANCELLED | No longer needed/feasible |

## Document Types

### Small Updates (tiny/small size)
- **3-5 phases maximum**
- **Simple linear progression**
- **Minimal dependencies**

Example phases:
1. Planning & Design
2. Implementation
3. Testing & Documentation

### Large Updates (medium/large size)
- **5-8 phases maximum**
- **Complex interdependencies**
- **Multiple implementation stages**

Example phases:
1. Planning & Requirements Analysis
2. Architecture Design
3. Core Implementation
4. Integration & Interface Development
5. Testing & Validation
6. Documentation & Polish
7. Deployment & Handoff

## Pipeline Creation vs Filtering Approach

### Modern Approach: Targeted Pipeline Creation
For experiment preset systems, focus on **creating specific pipelines** rather than filtering from a full matrix:

#### Variable Scopes & Locked Implementations
```markdown
### Preset Definition Structure
- **Variable Slots**: Specify which algorithm types vary (frame, color, lossy)
- **Variable Scope**: List exact algorithms/options to test for variable slots
- **Locked Implementations**: Specify exact algorithms/settings for non-variable slots

Example:
- Frame Slot: [Variable] ‚Üí All available frame reduction algorithms
- Color Slot: [Locked] ‚Üí FFmpeg color reduction at 32 colors
- Lossy Slot: [Locked] ‚Üí animately-advanced compression at level 40
```

## Claude Code Integration

**Claude Code MUST update scope documents as an integral part of every implementation task.** This is a core requirement, not an optional feature.

### Mandatory Update Protocol:
1. **Before starting any task**: Verify scope document exists and is current
2. **During implementation**: Update progress after each completed subtask
3. **After each work session**: Update phase progress percentage and current focus
4. **Upon task completion**: Mark phases/subtasks as complete with timestamps

### Enforcement Rules:
- **NO TASK IS COMPLETE** until its scope document is updated
- **EVERY SUBTASK COMPLETION** requires immediate document update  
- **PHASE TRANSITIONS** must be reflected in real-time
- **FAILURE TO UPDATE** means the work is considered incomplete

Human contributors must follow identical patterns when manually updating progress.

### Status Updates
**MANDATORY**: Update phase status immediately upon completion - no exceptions:

```markdown
### Phase 2: Implementation ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Progress:** 100% Complete
**Completed:** 2025-01-15
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING**: Completing implementation work without updating the scope document violates project requirements.

### Progress Tracking
**REQUIRED**: You must use specific completion percentages and current focus descriptions:

```markdown
### Phase 3: Testing üîÑ IN PROGRESS
**Progress:** 60% Complete
**Current Focus:** Integration test development
**Remaining:** Performance validation, edge case testing
```

### Completion Criteria
**MANDATORY**: Each phase must have clear, measurable completion criteria that are updated when met:

```markdown
#### Completion Criteria
- [ ] All unit tests passing (>95% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests implemented and passing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet targets
- [ ] Documentation updated
```

## Best Practices

### Phase Granularity
- Phases should be 1-3 days of work maximum
- Each phase should have 3-8 subtasks
- Subtasks should be 1-4 hours of work each

### Dependency Management
- Clearly mark inter-phase dependencies
- Use BLOCKED status when dependencies prevent progress
- Include dependency resolution in planning phases

### Documentation Standards
**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS** - These are not suggestions:
- **MUST** update status immediately upon phase completion
- **MUST** include specific completion dates and metrics  
- **MUST** document key decisions and architectural choices
- **MUST** maintain clear current focus descriptions
- **ZERO TOLERANCE** for outdated or incomplete documentation

## Template Usage

When creating new scope documents:

1. Copy frontmatter template and fill in project-specific details
2. Choose appropriate phase structure based on project size
3. Define clear completion criteria for each phase
4. Set up progress tracking with percentages and status indicators
5. Plan for Claude Code updates with specific checkpoint tasks

## Updating Progress - MANDATORY CHECKPOINTS

### When You Complete a Subtask:
**IMMEDIATE REQUIREMENT** - Complete ALL steps before moving to next task:
1. **MUST** update the checkbox: `- [x] Completed task`
2. **MUST** adjust the phase's **Progress:** percentage
3. **MUST** update **Current Focus:** to reflect next priority (e.g., "Moving to Subtask 1.3")
4. **MUST** change status icon to ‚úÖ COMPLETE if phase hits 100%
5. **MUST** add completion date: `**Completed:** 2025-01-15`

**‚ö†Ô∏è FAILURE TO COMPLETE ALL 5 STEPS = INCOMPLETE TASK**

### When You Start a New Phase:
**PRE-WORK REQUIREMENT** - Update document before writing any code:
1. **MUST** change status from ‚è≥ PLANNED to üîÑ IN PROGRESS
2. **MUST** set initial **Progress:** percentage (typically 0-10%)
3. **MUST** set **Current Focus:** to first major subtask (e.g., "Working on Subtask 2.1")
4. **MUST** mark first subtask as in progress if applicable

### Referencing Subtasks:
**MANDATORY PROTOCOL**:
- **ALWAYS** use the numbered format when discussing specific tasks: "Subtask 3.2 is blocked"  
- This enables precise communication about progress and dependencies
- Claude Code MUST efficiently update specific subtasks using these references

### Consequence of Non-Compliance:
**Tasks without corresponding scope document updates are considered incomplete and must be redone.**
