## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Tool Integration Framework
A flexible toolchain would be orchestrated by a central component. This component would be responsible for:
1.  **Receiving an input GIF** and a target quality goal.
2.  **Analyzing the content** by calling a feature extraction pipeline.
3.  **Querying an ML model** to get a recommendation for the best sequence of tools.
4.  **Executing the selected tool pipeline**, passing the output of one tool as the input to the next.
5.  **Returning the final, optimized GIF.**

### Feature Extraction Pipeline
A feature extraction pipeline would be responsible for analyzing a GIF and outputting a set of features that the ML models can use. This involves:
*   **Visual Feature Extraction**: Analyzing aspects like color distribution, motion patterns, and texture complexity from the raw pixel data.
*   **Structural Feature Extraction**: Parsing the GIF's metadata to find properties like frame count, dimensions, color palette size, and frame rate.

### ML Training Pipeline
The ML training pipeline is responsible for creating and updating the models. Its key responsibilities include:
*   **Training a Content Classifier**: Use a labeled dataset of GIFs to train a model that can automatically categorize new GIFs by content type.
*   **Training a Performance Predictor**: Use the results from our large-scale benchmarks to train a regression model that can predict the final file size and quality metrics for a given toolchain and GIF.
