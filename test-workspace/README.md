# Test Workspace

This directory contains manual testing, debugging, and temporary files.

## 📁 Structure

- **`manual/`** - Manual testing sessions (create subdirectories for each session)
- **`debug/`** - Debug investigations and troubleshooting
- **`temp/`** - Temporary files (auto-cleaned after 7 days)  
- **`samples/`** - Test samples and reference files

## 🧹 Cleanup

- **Automatic**: `temp/` files are cleaned automatically
- **Manual**: Clean up `manual/` and `debug/` directories after completing work
- See [Testing Best Practices](../docs/guides/testing-best-practices.md) for full guidelines

## 🚨 Important

**DO NOT** put testing files in the root directory! Always use this workspace.

*Keep the root directory clean and professional.*
