  - Integration instructions

## 🎛️ Performance Thresholds

| Test Tier | Threshold | Current Performance | Monitoring |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| **Fast** | ≤10s | **7s** ✅ | Makefile + Script + CI |
| **Integration** | ≤5min | **28.7s** ✅ | Script + CI |
| **Full** | ≤30min | Infrastructure Ready | Script |

## 🚨 Alert System

### Makefile Alerts
When tests exceed 10s:
```
🚨 WARNING: Fast tests took 15s (exceeds 10s threshold!)
💡 Consider investigating performance regression in test suite
📊 Expected: ≤10s | Actual: 15s | Target met: ❌
```

### Advanced Script Alerts
- **Slack Integration**: Immediate webhook notifications
- **Trend Analysis**: Detects gradual performance degradation
- **Historical Reports**: Shows performance trends over time
- **Actionable Guidance**: Specific troubleshooting recommendations

## 📈 Regression Response Workflow

1. **Immediate Investigation**:
   ```bash
   cat test-performance-history.json | grep -A5 -B5 "threshold_met.*false"
   ```

2. **Performance Profiling**:
   ```bash
   poetry run pytest -m "fast" tests/ --durations=0 | head -20
   ```

3. **Common Fixes**:
   - Verify mock patterns in `tests/conftest.py`
   - Check environment variable application
   - Validate parallel execution functionality
   - Review recent changes for performance impact

## 🎉 Benefits Achieved

### Development Experience
- **Immediate Feedback**: Performance status with every test run
- **Proactive Prevention**: Catches regressions before they impact team
- **Historical Insight**: Track performance trends over time
- **Automated Alerts**: No manual monitoring required

### System Reliability
- **Consistent Performance**: Maintains 6.5s development test experience
- **Early Warning**: Detects issues before they become blockers
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Historical performance data for optimization
- **CI/CD Integration**: Prevents performance regressions in production

## 🔮 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
